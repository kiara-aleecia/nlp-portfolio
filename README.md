# nlp-portfolio
This is a portfolio for Professor Mazidi's 4395 class (spring 2023) where we will be uploading our Human Language Technologies (Natural Language Processing) assignments throughout the semester.

## Intro to NLP
[This document](kam180013portfolio0.pdf) outlines some basic information about NLP and its history as well as my own personal interest in the topic.

[This document](kam180013portfolio1.pdf) describes our first text processing assignment written in Python.

## Assignments
(1) [Text Processing:](employee.py) process and sanitize employee information in a .csv file. This assignment primarily served as a way for the class to get more comfortable with using Python.
  - additional files: [data.csv](data.csv), [employees.pickle](employees.pickle)

(2) [Word Guessing Game:](word_guess_game.py) use a .txt file along with the NLTK library to reveal insights about lexical diversity and statistics for certain parts of speech within the sample. After processing, the 50 most common nouns from the text are used to play a word guessing game.
